After failing to push it over, the bird drops in pebbles one by one until the water rises to the top of the pitcher, allowing it to drink.  Various tellers of the story stress the crow\'s persistence.  In Francis Barlow\'s edition the proverb \'Necessity is the mother of invention\' is applied to the story while an early 20th-century retelling quotes the proverb \'Where there\'s a will, there\'s a way\'.'
