Along with RNA and proteins, DNA is one of the three major macromolecules essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules are double-stranded helices, consisting of two long biopolymers of simpler units called nucleotides --each nucleotide is composed of a nucleobase (guanine, adenine, thymine, and cytosine), recorded using the letters G, A, T, and C.2) Root Border â€“ An extension of the "Tree of Life" that combines and intertwines world history.

First thought to be a tally stick, but some scientists have suggested that the groupings of notches indicate a mathematical understanding that goes beyond counting. They are believed to be more than 20,000 years old.
